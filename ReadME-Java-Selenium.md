# Atlantbh_Zadatak
I created automated smoke test using Java amd Selenium webdriver.
In the email with my assignments from Lejla Mehmedovic, I was told to push my assigments with documentation on how to run the automated tests here. I created repository and pushed my assignments but I was unable to make that test runs here on github using Actions.
I can run my test on eclipseIDE without any errors and problems
